# Princeton Plasma Lab Neural-Network with Data Visualizer 
Work I did at PPPL in the summer of 2018. Thank you to everyone who made the program so wonderful and Dr. Dan Boyer for his support and guidence in the completion of this project. 

# Poster Presentation
Please refer to the "FINAL_Vaish_Gajaraj_PPPL_Poster.pdf" for the poster presented at the 60th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics and created during my time working for Princeton's Plasma Physics Lab.

# Drafted Report
The PDF "Accelerated predictive modeling of the current profile evolution on NSTX-U using neural networks" contains my project write up and the details of my implementation. 

# Neural Network
"nubeamnet.py" contains the implementation functions of my Convolutional Neural Network used in this project. BootstrapPPLAS_Train are the scripts used to train the neural networks. 

# Widgit Tool 
Please refer to "viewnubeamnet.py" to view the visualization tool for these machine learning models. Built with Javascript applications.  


Thank you to Dr. Mark Dan Boyer for his mentorship in this project.
