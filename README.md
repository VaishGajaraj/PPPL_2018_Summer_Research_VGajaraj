# Princeton Plasma Lab Neural-Network with Data Visualizer 
Work I did at PPPL in the summer of 2018. Thank you to everyone who made the program so wonderful and Dr. Dan Boyer for his support and guidence in the completion of this project. 

# Viewing my Poster Project and Paper
Please refer to the folder titled Paper and Project to find my poster presented at the 60th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics and created during my time working for Princeton's Plasma Physics Lab. The PDF "Accelerated predictive modeling of the current profile evolution on NSTX-U using neural networks" contains my project write up and the details of my implementation. 

# Neural Network
"nubeamnet.py" contains the implementation functions of my Convolutional Neural Network used in this project. BootstrapPPLAS_Train are the scripts used to train the neural networks. 

# Widgit Tool 
Please refer to "viewnubeamnet.py" to view the visualization tool for these machine learning models. Built with Javascript applications.  


# Models
This folder contains the raw pickle data that contains my developed models. These can be viewed using the Widget Tool
